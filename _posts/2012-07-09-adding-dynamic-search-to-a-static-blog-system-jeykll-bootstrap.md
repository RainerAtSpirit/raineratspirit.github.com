Yeah, I know, just having a couple of posts out here and already start thinking about dynamic searching,
what an overkill ;-). On the other site I found a great blog post from [Ed Hotchkins](http://edwardhotchkiss
.com/blog/2012/03/11/jekyll-live-search-with-angular.js/) that talks about most of the moving parts already. As I
haven't worked with AngularJS a lot yet, I thought this might be a good oppertunity.
