The obvious challenge: Where and how to start blogging. The answer: After deciding to use github pages and jekyll to
host a static blog [this blog here](http://blended.co.nz/tech/2012/01/15/blogging-fun-part-2-set-up) brought me up to speed.
I'm especially glad that I  found the [the_program](https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-the-program) theme as I'm
not a great designer at all.
