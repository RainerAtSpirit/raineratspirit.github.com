The obvious challenge: Where and how to start blogging. The answer: After deciding to use github pages and jekyll to
host a static blog [this blog here](http://blended.co.nz/tech/2012/01/15/blogging-fun-part-2-set-up) brought me up to speed.
I'm especially glad about finding [the_program](https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-the-program) theme,
which provides a great responsive design without looking like 'twitter bootstrap' at all ;-).
