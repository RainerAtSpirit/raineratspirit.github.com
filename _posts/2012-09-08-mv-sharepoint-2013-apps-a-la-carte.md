Hey there,

Welcome to our small SharePoint App restaurant, where we serve the best client side MV* crossover SharePoint apps
world wide. So what make us so special and what do you mean when you say *cross-over*.
There are already a couple of Visual studio 2012 C# templates of Apps SharePoint 2013 out there already like
SharePoint-hosted, Autohosted or Provider-hosted and the two later come with variations that either have an empty `app
 web`.
And there is the world of client side single page application (SPA) that can be easily mixed into it. There are a
more than a dozen libraries/frameworks that helps you writing your SPA.
